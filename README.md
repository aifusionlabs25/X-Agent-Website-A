# AI Fusion Labs X Agent Website

This repository is the single source of truth for the public X Agent website and its agent integrations. Amy's Anam experience, memory lane, AgentMail handoff, Hermes backend work, and live intelligence features are maintained here.

## Production path

- GitHub repository: `aifusionlabs25/X-Agent-Website-A`
- Canonical production branch: `main`
- Vercel project: `x-agent-website-a`
- Production site: [xagent.aifusionlabs.app](https://xagent.aifusionlabs.app)
- Amy public route: `/agents/amy`; **Meet with Amy** continues through the private `/demo/amy?variant=cara4` check-in and session flow.

Do not deploy production from the archived Tavus repository or the old Insight Amy working repository. They remain reference sources until their useful material has been migrated and verified here.

Before any production merge or deployment, follow [the production runbook](docs/operations/PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md). The build includes a deployment contract that prevents Amy from shipping with missing or mismatched memory settings.

## Local development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
